# Demo
In this demo I try to describe the steps to create a dotnet project template.

For solution called Extended.WebApi, will start with the default WebAPI project and I'll work on it by adding more "stuff" that we usually need, such as:

Logging, Model Validation, Exception Handling and so on. 

## Steps
* 1 - Clean Default Solution
* 2 - Add Logging support
*
